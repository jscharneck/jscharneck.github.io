            <h3 class="heading one">Partnerships &amp; Affiliations</h3>
            <br>

            <p>In the current economic situation, it becomes mandatory for institutions to increase their networking opportunities through affiliations and partnerships. When partnerships are implemented correctly, the private sector can increase efficiency and choice, and expand access to education services, particularly for households that tend to be poorly served by traditional delivery methods.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Richfieldâ€™s relations with the private sector, encompass cooperation with business corporations, small and medium enterprises, professional and economic associations as well as other organizations of the business community, individuals, communities, parents and families.</p>           
            <br>
            
            <p>Richfield recognizes that when we collaborate with some of the most ambitious organizations, we can multiply our impact in areas from education to economic development to poverty alleviation because of our ISO 9001:2015 accreditation status! We have enduring partnerships and affiliations with a number of like-minded organizations and leaders who are eager to help drive global change and deliver true results.</p>
            <br>
